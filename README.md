# README Generator

## Overview

The README Generator is a Python application designed to automatically generate comprehensive `README.md` files for GitHub repositories. It utilizes advanced language models (GPT-4o-mini and Gemini) to analyze repository contents and produce well-structured documentation, including project descriptions, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

- **Automatic Cloning**: Clones any specified GitHub repository to a temporary directory for analysis.
- **Content Analysis**: Reads the contents of important files in the repository to gather relevant information.
- **README Generation**: Uses state-of-the-art AI models to generate a detailed `README.md` file based on the repository's content.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Integrates with multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and Google Gemini) for enhanced versatility.
- **Logging**: Provides informative logging for tracking the progress and troubleshooting potential issues.

## Files

- `app.py`: The main application file that handles user input, repository cloning, content reading, and README generation using GPT-4o.
- `gemini.py`: A variant that uses the Gemini API to generate concise README files with rate limit handling.
- `mistral.py`: Another variant that leverages Hugging Face's Mixtral model for generating README files.
- `LICENSE`: The MIT License under which this project is distributed.

## Installation

To run the README Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamza-amin-4365/readme-generator.git
   cd readme-generator
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install langchain_openai google-generativeai python-dotenv
     ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     huggingfacehub_api_token=your_huggingfacehub_token
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   To generate a `README.md` for a specific GitHub repository, run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   or for the Gemini version:
   ```bash
   python gemini.py <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Input the Repository URL**:
   When prompted, enter the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze.

3. **Generated README**:
   After successful execution, a `README.md` file will be created in the current directory with the generated content.

## Logging

The application uses the built-in `logging` module to provide insights into its operation. You can adjust the logging level in the source code if you wish to see more or less detail.

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for any improvements or additional features.

## Disclaimer and future work
This readme file was generated by one of the scripts written here. This also serve as the demo for you, how your readme file will look like. Don't input the repos having very large amount of code because you have a token limit in APIs. In future we shall be using fine-tuned models to exclude the need of paid APIs and use generative ai techniques to handle large amount of code bases. If you want to contribute you're very welcome to do so.
